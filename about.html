          <h1>Hi! Thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
          <p>I love the coastal town of Mombasa, which is where I work and live
           with my family. I grew up watching cartoons like the Roadrunner show,
            Popeye the sailor and my most favorite Tom and Jerry. I have been to 
            Mt. Kenya and got mountain sick with just 4 kilometers to the peak. 
            I started my professional career as a teacher in a vocational technical 
            training institute, teaching computer subjects like programming in C++, 
            PASCAL, Data Communication and MySQL databases to college students. I started
             my Cisco career in 2011 and certified for CCNA in September 2015, in 2019 
             July I completed my CCNP and that was how my career changed. To simulate 
             networks, I use EVE-NG which is a pretty awesome tool to build network 
             topologies and test multivendor technologies.
